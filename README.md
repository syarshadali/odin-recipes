<h1>Odin Recipes</h1>

Welcome to my first project!

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This project is about my favorite recipes which defines its preparation time and cook time, the ingredients used in making the recipe and step by step instructions how to cook it.</p>
<p>This project also demonstrates the use of ordered and unordered lists and mathematical notations.</p>
<p>This project is the result of git workflow, lots of git add + git commit commands and git push to push the piece of code to github.</p>
<p>This is a very simple website created by using only html tags which I have learned so far. These html tags define the basic structure of the site. The styling of the project will come soon.</p>
<p>Following are the html tags which I used in making this site:
html, head, title, body, h1, h2, h3, img, a, p, sup, sub.</p>
